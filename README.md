The only role-play-game you want to play from now on

Hi!

First of all, Thank you for stopping by! 
This was a project of the Scrimba-Course. The focus was on contructor-functions and Classes. 
I learned a lot through this project. It tought me, how I can make things easier by creating
Classes for objects. But also it sharpened my Array-Skills
